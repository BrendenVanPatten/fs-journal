# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? 
Actually being able to write some code that works and is fuctional. I started the week thinking holy crap what have gotten myself into, and i still believe this will be extremely challenging but i feel slightly better than i did.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
That i was able to do a several different things without a 'ton' of help 
- What are you struggling with?
Still thinking that i might be over my head and hoping stuff will click eventually, and hoping i turn stuff in the right way on github.
- What would you count as a victory?
able to do my checkpoint(I think) without a ton of help, felt pretty good, i was able to find where i had an error with side scroll and fix it.
